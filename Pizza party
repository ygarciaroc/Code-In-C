/* calculator for counting total of pizzas desired to be purchased for a party */

// given # of people attending, output of the # of people, # of pizzas needed, and total cost.
// people have 2 slices of pizza each
// each pizza has 12 slices and costs $14.95.

// putput floating-point value with two digits after the decimal using the following:
// printf("Cost: $%0.2lf\n", cost);

//if input is:
// = 20

// the output is:
// people: 20
// pizza (s) needed: 4
// cost for 4 pizza (s): $59.80

//Hint: use the ceil() function to round up the number of pizzas so that enough pizzas
// are ordered.
