//lab problem: people's weights
// --------------------- Description -------------------------- // 
// Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, 
// which can be achieved as follows: printf("%0.2lf", yourValue);

// Prompt the user to enter five numbers, being five people's weights.
// Store the numbers in an array of doubles. Output the array's numbers
// on one line, each number followed by one space. (2 pts)
// (2) Also output the total weight, by summing the array's elements. (1 pt)
// (3) Also output the average of the array's elements. (1 pt)
// (4) Also output the max array element. (2 pts)

// approach to solution: use arrays
// Hint: Make sure to initialize the second smallest and smallest integers properly.
